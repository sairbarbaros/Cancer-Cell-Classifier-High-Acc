# Cancer-Cell-Classifier-High-Acc
Predict which cell is cancerous with 96% accuracy using SVM machine learning algorithm.

The model is very accurate verified by F1 score, jaccard index and confusion matrix.

Support Vector Machine(SVM) Algorithm:
                
                *Projects data to the higher-dimensions, than classifies them using a kernel.
                
                *Kernel function can be selected among linear, polynomial, RBF, and sigmoid. All are present in main.ipynb.
                
                *This algorithm fits very well for the data since our data is not very big.

The dataset is present in the repo.
